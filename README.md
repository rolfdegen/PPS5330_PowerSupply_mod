# PPS5330_PowerSupply_mod
Reverse Engineered Firmware for the ELV PPS5330 Power Supply and hardware modification for faster output voltage slew rate

* All Basic functionality is working, the Power Supply is in a usable state
* Added Temperature measuring of the internal heatsink and transformer with display on LCD
* PWM controlled FAN dependend on Heatsink's Temperature
* Voltage Calibration
* Current Calibration
* faster output voltage slew rate
* Measure transformer temperature
* Menu with LCD contrast/backlit settings
* Calibration of internal ADC measurements
* Timeout for Display-Settings-Menu

Temperature display: Long time is heatsink, short time is transformer
